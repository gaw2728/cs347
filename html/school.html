                <h4>My School Experience.</h4>
                <p>I started out as a Northern Virginia Community College student trying to find out what they wanted to do.
                    On my way to earning a chemistry or biology degree I decided to make a switch to computer science.
                    Now I am a soon-to-be graduate from James Madison University with a BS degree in Computer Science and
                    a minor in Human Resource Development ready to meet new people and learn new things.</p>
        
                <p>While at school I participated in multiple extra-curricular activities. At NOVA I was fervent about
                    students having a place to go after a hard work week, so I participated in and eventually became joint
                    president of "Game Knights". This club at NOVA would meet once a week to socalize around the games.
                    We would participate in card games, board games, table-top games, video games, and more that could be
                    organized. I learned about management and organizational responsibility from my time with them.

                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>While at James Madison University I could not participate to the same level of involvement, however I 
                    attended meeting for both the Unix Users Group [UUG] and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Guild [SFFG].
                    In the Unix Users group I was able to learn more about Unix based systems, shell, editors, and 
                    C (programming language). The Science Fiction and Fantasy Guild was alot like the club I headed at
                    NOVA giving students a place to come decompress after their hard work.
