                <h4>Introduction: "<code>system.out.print("HELLO WORLD!);</code>"</h4>
                <p>Hello, and congratulations on finding my website! I would be elated if you took a moment to look around.
                    Site navigation is at the top and bottom of each page. If you're here on important business you may want
                    to check out the <a href="school.html">"Schooling"</a> page, it will have information about my credentials.
                    The "<a href="contactme.html">Contact Me</a>" page will have all the details about how you can connect with
                    me. If it interests you, continue reading to learn some more general things about me.
                </p>
                <h4>Who am I?</h4>
                <p>I would say I'm definately an odd-ball of different era's. Born on January 1st, 1991 I'm both young enough to
                    be considered a Millennial but also old enough to remember the startings of commercial internet, AOL, GameBoy,
                    and DOS. I have always loved technology and it's potential, but before formal schooling I would say I mostly
                    dabbled and played with it. Video games were always an interest to me and the thoughts of how they worked.
                    I remember messing around on our computer when I was 5-ish before the big internet boom learning the gist
                    of the windows directory system before my grandfather could turn the machine on! Ever sience then I've
                    been a tinkerer, always looking for new little things I could do. What I lacked in direct knowledge I made
                    up for in determination and work ethic.<br><br>
                    Outside of technology I have always loved the beach and the ocean. My original thought in life was that
                    I would become a marine biologist. Though for the moment that dream seems to have stopped I still love
                    snorkeling, walking on the beach, and hope to someday learn how to man a sailing vessle.<br><br>
                    At the moment I would say I haven't found my work passion, but I try to not let that get to me. The positive
                    takaway just means that I'm willing to try and do different things. But until I do find out what that is I get
                    to spend my time with my highschool school sweet heart of 13 years. After this semester we plan to make the
                    marriage official.
